        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Gabriel Canonoy, and I am currently a Political Science / International Affairs major at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently in my second year here, and am looking to possibly work a government job in the future, especially in the international field. Although I am currently still in my undergraduate years at the University of California, Riverside, I have experience working in a governmental position, albeit small.<br><br>

        As of right now, I am currently a council member for the city of Moreno Valley. The council I serve under is called the Emerging Leaders Council, or ELC for short. At the Emerging Leaders Council, we discuss issues in regards to the youth in the city. We also plan events for them and figure out ways to get more youth engagement in the city. We are the representatives for the youth, so we want to make sure that they are able to have a say in what we do and are represented well to the other councils. Together, with the mayor of Moreno Valley, Ulysses Cabbrera, we try to come up with events that the youth can actively engage in. For example, just recently we came up with the Easter Egg Hunt youth event at the garden behind city hall. Many came and overall the children had a fun time. As of right now, we are currently working on three big projects. Our first big project is to work on a float that represents the youth and the Emerging Leaders Council at the Moreno Valley Parade over the summer. Next, we plan on doing something for Pride Month or something else in order to represent the youth who are a part of the LGBTQIA+ Community. Last but not least, the last project we are working on will involve the high school and middle school students of Moreno Valley. By writing an essay on a prompt of our choosing, those who write the best essays will have a chance to become Mayor for the day. They will shadow Mayor Cabbrera and see whether or not the realm of politics is something that they would like to pursue in the future.<br><br>

        At the moment, I am currently employed as a Sales Associate at Big 5 Sporting Goods in Moreno Valley California. I have been working for the company at that location for almost a year, as I started working there in August of the year 2022. As a Sales Associate, most of my responsibilities during my shifts usually revolve around helping out the customers whenever they need to find an item or items. However, since our shoe department is our most important and most popular department at the store, I am usually helping out customers find the shoe that they need and find the size that suits them perfectly. Apart from helping out the customers, I also restock items out onto the sales floor whenever we are low on displays. I also clean out the back rooms so that it would be easier to move around, despite the amount of product and trash there is back there. Although I am currently employed, I would like the opportunity to work either through internship or part-time in order to gain more experience in the political field, as it is something I am very interested in and am somewhat well-versed in.
